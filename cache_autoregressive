This suggests a problem that could potentially disrupt operations, hence it is graded as 'BAD'.\n\n\nLOG --> [WARNING] CPU usage at 80%, recommended to monitor.\n\nGRADE --> NEUTRAL\n\nReason: The log provides a warning about high CPU usage but also includes a recommendation to monitor the situation. It is informative and advises on a potential issue without indicating an immediate problem or a positive outcome. Therefore, it is considered neutral.\n\n\nLOG --> [SUCCESS] Data backup completed successfully.\n\nGRADE --> GOOD\n\nReason: The log indicates a successful completion of a data backup, which is a positive event. It implies that the system is functioning correctly and that important data is secure. This is a good outcome, hence it is graded as 'GOOD'.\n\n\nLOG --> [CRITICAL] Database connection lost, immediate attention required.\n\nGRADE --> BAD\n\nReason: The log describes a critical issue where a database connection has been lost, which requires immediate attention. This is a severe problem that could lead to data loss or system downtime, making it a negative event. Therefore, it is graded as 'BAD'.\n\n\nLOG --> [INFO] Scheduled maintenance to improve system performance.\n\nGRADE --> NEUTRAL\n\nReason: The log informs about scheduled maintenance to improve system performance. While maintenance is a necessary process, it does not inherently indicate a problem or a positive outcome. It is a neutral statement as it simply provides information about an upcoming event.\n\n\nLOG --> [NOTICE] Software update available, enhancing security features.\n\nGRADE --> GOOD\n\nReason: The log announces a software update that enhances security features. This is a positive development as it implies an improvement in the system's security, which is beneficial for users and the organization. Therefore, it is graded as 'GOOD'.\n\n\nLOG"
